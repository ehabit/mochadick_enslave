# Enslave

Enslave is a villager slavery mod for Minecraft.  Enslave is part of the greater Mocha Dick universe of mods.  Mocha Dick mods focus on the glory of whaling, slavery, and piracy.  We are building this mod for all of the lost boys and girls, may it bring you joy on this sullen sea.  We don't try to be politically correct here.

Enslave is currently compatible with Minecraft 1.7.10.
